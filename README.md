# React, Tailwind CSS, and Sanity.io Starter

## What is this?

- This is a starter project for a React, Tailwind CSS, and Sanity.io project.
- I think these are two technologies that are really cool and I wanted to try them out together.
- I also wanted to try out Sanity.io as a CMS, soooooo, this here is basically a "Hello World" for that.

## How do I use this?

- Clone this repo
- Start this repo
- Follow me
- run `npm install` in the parent directory
- setup a Sanity.io project @sanity.io website
- Idk how to explain this but.... `const client = createClient({
    projectId: "f3rzwmrv",
    dataset: "production",
    apiVersion: "2023-03-31",
    useCdn: false,
});`... you get the idea. Study the App.jsx for that.
- run `npx sanity dex` to start the dev server
- run `npm run dev` to run the react app (Using super duppa fast Vite by the way, shout out to @vite team)
- run `npm run build` to build the react app

## What's next?

- More docs and stuff (I'm lazy)

### NB: Write your own docs.... HAHAHA
